Welcome to our Trivia Maze!  We have spent a long time working to create a game that anyone would enjoy, as long as
they have a bit of trivia knowledge.

Upon opening the game, you are directed to a main menu, which contains 6 buttons.
LOAD PREVIOUS GAME:  Starts your game where you left off last
START A NEW GAME:  Creates a new game
SCOREBOARD:  Shows the scores of the players who have participated (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
HELP (indicated by a "?"):  Shows all the instructions on how to play the game
SETTINGS (indicated by a "gear"):  Allows one to change the volume of the music and effects, or clear the scoreboard
EXIT (red button): exits the game



Here are some helpful cheats (and make sure you type them in correctly!):
NUQU: generates a new question
GTQR: gets the question right
WHEREAMI: activates label that shows your current location
WWCD: immediately sends you to the final room ("Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!")
