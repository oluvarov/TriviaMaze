Welcome to our Trivia Maze!  We have spent a long time working to create a game that anyone would enjoy, as long as
they have a bit of trivia knowledge.

Menu features:

Upon opening the application, you are directed to a main menu, which contains 6 buttons.
LOAD PREVIOUS GAME:  Starts your game where you left off last
START A NEW GAME:  Creates a new game
SCOREBOARD:  Shows the scores of the players who have participated (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
HELP (indicated by a "?"):  Shows all the instructions on how to play the game
SETTINGS (indicated by a "gear"):  Allows one to change the volume of the music and effects, or clear the scoreboard
EXIT (red button): exits the game

When you select "START A NEW GAME", you will be redirected to a new screen where you can select a difficulty.  These
difficulties correspond with maze sizes, ranging from 4-by-4 to 6-by-6.  Upon selecting a difficulty, the player may
then proceed to the game.

How to play:

You will begin the game in the top-left corner of the maze (at row 0, column 0).  Your goal is to reach the bottom-right
corner, which varies depending on difficulty set.  For example, if you selected the 4-by-4 maze, your goal would be to
reach row 3, column 3.

You start here -> (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3)
                  (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)
                  (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)
                  (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) <- You want to end here

In order to do so, you will need to cross a series of bridges, which require you to answer a trivia question.  These
questions can be multiple-choice, true-false, or short answer, and will be displayed on the right side of the screen.
To attempt to cross a bridge, simply click on the bridge on your device.  A question will be prompted that you must
answer before continuing.  If you get the question right, you are now free to cross the bridge for the rest of the game.
If you get the question wrong, the bridge disappears, and you must find a different way around.

If you were to close off all the bridges around your island, then the game informs you that you have lost.  If there
does not appear to be a way to reach the exit, you can click the GIVE UP button at the top left of the screen.  However,
if you make it to the bottom-right corner, you have won the game!

If for any reason you cannot finish your game, then you can exit and the game automatically saves your progress. Just
come back, click "LOAD PREVIOUS GAME" in the main menu, and you will be back where you left off!

Here are some helpful cheats (and make sure you type them in correctly!):
NUQU: generates a new question
GTQR: answers the question correctly
WHEREAMI: activates label that shows your current location
WWCD: immediately sends you to the final room ("Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!")
